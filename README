# Jay's Arch Linux Configs
This repo contains config files for Arch Linux with i3.
It configures the following modules:
  1: i3
  2: polybar (for which some custom modules have been written).

It requires the following modules:
  1: yay (for the installer)
  2: Xorg-xinit (X server in general)
  3: i3 (is installed by the installer)
  4: polybar (is installed by the installer)
  5: kitty (default terminal in the config)
  6: firefox (default browser for the config)
  7: feh (for the backgrounds)
  8: i3-dmenu-launcher (alternative for dmenu)
All modules, except yay, are installed by the installer (./install.sh), which also copies all files to their intended destination
If wanted, you can run [./other.sh], which install a bunch of other packages as well.
To run both, simply run [./other.sh -c], which does all you need.
